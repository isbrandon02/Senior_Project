        <p class="infopage2">Strabismus, often referred to as "crossed eyes" or "squint," is a visual disorder characterized by an imbalance in the muscles that control eye movement. This imbalance causes one eye to deviate from its normal alignment, leading to misalignment of the eyes. Strabismus can be constant or intermittent and may manifest as one eye turning inward, outward, upward, or downward. This misalignment can result in double vision and impaired depth perception. It can be caused by various factors, including genetics, muscle weaknesses, or neurological issues (Cleveland Clinic).</p>

    <div>
        <p class="infopage2">Amblyopia, also known as "lazy eye," is a condition in which one eye does not develop normal vision during childhood. It often occurs as a consequence of strabismus, but it can also be caused by a difference in prescription between the eyes or other eye health issues (Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital). In amblyopia, the brain tends to favor one eye over the other, leading to poor vision in the affected eye. If left untreated, amblyopia can result in permanent vision impairment in the weaker eye.</p>
    </div>

  <p class="info middle bruh">The relationship between strabismus and amblyopia lies in the fact that strabismus can lead to amblyopia (Optimax, 22). When the eyes are misaligned due to strabismus, the brain may suppress the input from one eye to avoid double vision. This suppression can cause amblyopia in the neglected eye. Conversely, amblyopia can contribute to the development of strabismus, as the misalignment of the eyes can worsen over time.</p>
